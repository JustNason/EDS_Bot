## EDS Robot

This is a GitHub repo containing the source code of my atonomous robotics project "EDS_Bot"

You can copy this repo and replace all instances of `eds_bot` within the launcher files with the name of your robot. Alse ensure that while following this README.md you replace eds_bot to the name of your robot when referencing the package. 
**EX:** `ros2 launch eds_bot launch_robot.launch.py`, replace `eds_bot` with the name of your robot.

This repository was created from _Josh Newans'_ [articubot_one](https://github.com/joshnewans/articubot_one), a very special thanks to him.
